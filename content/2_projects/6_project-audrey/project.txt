After some study projects of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), I wanted to summarize what i've done into one project.</br>\nAs the result, I built a virtual gallery into web browser. Audience can navigate the gallery by both swiping gesture and arrow key input. I choose Audrey Hepburn's photo taken by Yousuf Karsh as original image for its superior image quality."
